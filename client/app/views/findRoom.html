    <h1>Planning Poker</h1>
    <p>
      Planning poker, also called Scrum poker, is a consensus-based technique for estimating,
      mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of user stories in software development.
      It is a variation of the Wideband Delphi method. It is most commonly used in agile 
      software development, in particular the Extreme Programming methodology.
